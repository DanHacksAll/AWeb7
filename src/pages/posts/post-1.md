Welcome to my _new blog_ about Aweb7! Here, I will share my journey as I build a new website for the team.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Developed this whole website**: I been building this website for around 3 days, It needs some style, but, it's coming.

## What's next

I will finish the site and some updates will follow after that. Decentralizing has never been so easy, wait for it.
